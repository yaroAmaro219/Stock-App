1. Title: A working title for your app. (Feel free to have some fun with this.)
Finance-App
2. Description: 4 to 5 sentences in non-technical speak summarizing the features, functions, and goals.
The goal of this project is to create a app that makes an api call when you search a stoxk ticker, and returns the stock with some details. I want to add as many things as I can by the end of the time limit. One thing to include is  a watchlist and a more details page.

3. Wireframes: Mockups of your app on desktop, tablet, and mobile.


4. Component Heirarchy: A visual tree of your components, depicting the parent/child relationships, as well as an indication of which will be class components, requiring state, and which will be functional components, taking props.

6. MVP: Your goals for MVP, including the minimum, need-to-have features of your app.
Have a searching section that calls data. Have an area that you can save stocks in. Have a more details page when you click on a stock. Have a nav bar that brings you Home once you're done looking at data

7. Post-MVP: Write out what your goals are for post-MVP, including nice-to-have features that you would like to implement once your MVP is complete. (If you plan to use a component library, please link that here as well.)
I'd like to implement an area where people can post what they thing about certain stocks. I'd also like to set up a log in where people can see their info once they have logged in.
